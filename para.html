A paragraph is a group of sentences that develop a single idea or point: 
Structure
A paragraph is typically made up of three parts: a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the paragraph, and the supporting sentences develop that idea. 
Length
A paragraph is usually around 250 words and five to six sentences long, but this can vary depending on the purpose of the paragraph and the length of the piece. 
Purpose
Paragraphs help organize ideas in a logical order and guide the reader through a piece of writing. They also show where the subdivisions of a piece of writing begin and end. 
Writing
To write an effective paragraph, you should start with a topic sentence, support the main idea with other sentences, and maintain a consistent flow. You can insert a paragraph break when you transition between ideas or add a new line of thought.
